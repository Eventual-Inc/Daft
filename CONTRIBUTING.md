## Contributor Community

The Daft contributor community celebrates and supports the contributors who have helped shape the project into what it is today. Whether you‚Äôre submitting your first pull request or enhancing the documentation, you‚Äôll find a place in our growing community. Members contribute in different ways and take on a variety of roles.

### Daft User
A user is someone who interacts with our software. They support the Daft project by sharing feedback with developers through bug reports and feature requests. Users also enrich the Daft community by answering questions and assisting others on mailing lists and support forums.

### Daft Contributor
A contributor is someone who actively adds to the project through code or documentation. They go beyond basic use by engaging with the developer mailing list, joining discussions, and offering patches, documentation, suggestions, or constructive feedback.

### Daft Committer
A committer is a developer who has consistently made meaningful contributions to the project and has been invited to this role based on the merit of their work. Committers are granted write access to specific parts of the code repository, have a signed committer agreement on file, and receive a daft.ai email address. With the ability to apply patches directly to code or documentation, they can make short-term decisions within their areas of expertise. These changes are then subject to review: the Daft Punks may approve them as permanent or choose to reject them.

### Daft Punqs
A Daft Punq is a committer who is part of the core Daft team, recognized for sustained and meaningful contributions to the project‚Äôs growth and direction over time. They hold write access to the code repository, a daft.ai email address, voting rights on community decisions, and the ability to nominate other active contributors for committership.
