        message: |
          This PR is being prevented from merging because you need at least one of the required labels:

          ```
          enhancement | performance | bug | chore | documentation | dependencies
          ```

          The canonical and easiest way of adding them is to add the following prefixes to your PR title:

          * [FEAT]: adds the `enhancement` label
          * [PERF]: adds the `performance` label
          * [BUG]: adds the `bug` label
          * [CHORE]: adds the `chore` label
          * [DOCS]: adds the `documentation` label

          Thanks for helping us categorize and manage our PRs!
