"""
This file contains physical plan building blocks.
To get a physical plan for a logical plan, see physical_plan_factory.py.

Conceptually, a physical plan decides what steps, and the order of steps, to run to build some target.
Physical plans are closely related to logical plans. A logical plan describes "what you want", and a physical plan figures out "what to do" to get it.
They are not exact analogues, especially due to the ability of a physical plan to dynamically decide what to do next.

Physical plans are implemented here as an iterator of PartitionTask | None.
When a physical plan returns None, it means it cannot tell you what the next step is,
because it is waiting for the result of a previous PartitionTask to can decide what to do next.
