# daft-proto

## Structure

- daft-proto (definitions only)
- daft-ir (depends on daft-proto)

## TODOs

- fix naming of things as it's inconsistent
- will have to fix ciruclar import issues with subqueries at some point
- the from_proto helpers are weird.
- consider using macros or something better.
- having things return box/arc is odd and less flexible.
- likely need a common
- consider putting all in one file because why not.
- consider a detailed payload to the run operation.
