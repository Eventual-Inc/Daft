    # title: Potential segfault in the time crate
    # This can be ignored because it only affects users that use the feature flag "clock" of "chrono",
    # which we do not. Specifically: 
    # * the call of "localtime_r" [is unsound](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/602#issuecomment-940445390)
    # * that call [is part of the module "sys"](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.19/src/chrono/sys/unix.rs.html#84)
    # * "sys" is only available on feature "clock": https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.19/src/chrono/lib.rs.html#456
    # 
    # Therefore, this advisory does not affect us.
