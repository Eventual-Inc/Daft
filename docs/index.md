# Overview

Welcome to **Daft**!

Daft is a high-performance data engine providing simple and reliable data processing for any modality and scale, from local to petabyte-scale distributed workloads. The core engine is written in Rust and exposes both SQL and Python DataFrame interfaces as first-class citizens.

## Why Daft?

**:octicons-image-24: Unified multimodal data processing**

Break down data silos with a single framework that handles structured tables, unstructured text, and rich media like imagesâ€”all with the same intuitive API. Why juggle multiple tools when one can do it all?

**:material-language-python: Python-native, no JVM required**

Built for modern AI/ML workflows with Python at its core and Rust under the hood. Skip the JVM complexity, version conflicts, and memory tuning to achieve 20x faster start timesâ€”get the performance without the Java tax.

**:fontawesome-solid-laptop: Seamless scaling, from laptop to cluster**

Start local, scale globalâ€”without changing a line of code. Daft's Rust-powered engine delivers blazing performance on a single machine and effortlessly extends to distributed clusters when you need more horsepower.

## Key Features

* **Native Multimodal Processing**: Process any data typeâ€”from structured tables to unstructured text and rich mediaâ€”with native support for images, embeddings, and tensors in a single, unified framework.

* **Rust-Powered Performance**: Experience breakthrough speed with our Rust foundation delivering vectorized execution and non-blocking I/O that processes the same queries with 5x less memory while consistently outperforming industry standards by an order of magnitude.

* **Seamless ML Ecosystem Integration**: Slot directly into your existing ML workflows with zero frictionâ€”whether you're using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pola.rs/), or [HuggingFace models](https://huggingface.co/models), Daft works where you work.

* **Universal Data Connectivity**: Access data anywhere it livesâ€”cloud storage ([S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [GCS](https://cloud.google.com/storage)), modern table formats ([Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/), [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/)), or enterprise catalogs ([Unity](https://www.unitycatalog.io/), [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/))â€”all with zero configuration.

* **Push your code to your data**: Bring your Python functions directly to your data with zero-copy UDFs powered by [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), eliminating data movement overhead and accelerating processing speeds.

* **Out of the Box reliability**: Deploy with confidenceâ€”intelligent memory management prevents OOM errors while sensible defaults eliminate configuration headaches, letting you focus on results, not infrastructure.

<!-- ## Frequently Asked Questions

todo(docs - jay): Add answers to each and more questions if necessary

??? quote "What does Daft do well? (or What should I use Daft for?)"

    todo(docs): this is from 10 min quickstart, filler answer for now

    Daft is the right tool for you if you are working with:

    - **Large datasets** that don't fit into memory or would benefit from parallelization
    - **Multimodal data types** such as images, JSON, vector embeddings, and tensors
    - **Formats that support data skipping** through automatic partition pruning and stats-based file pruning for filter predicates
    - **ML workloads** that would benefit from interact computation within a DataFrame (via UDFs)
