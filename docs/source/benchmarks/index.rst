High Level Overview
-------------------
A Dataframe can be thought of conceptually as a "table of data", with rows and columns. If you are familiar with Pandas or Spark Dataframes, you will be right at home with Daft! Dataframes are used for:

* Interactive Data Science: Performing interactive and ad-hoc exploration of data in a Notebook environment
* Extract/Transform/Load (ETL): Defining data pipelines that clean and process data for consumption by other users
* Data Analytics: Analyzing data by producing summaries and reports

Daft Dataframe focuses on Machine Learning/Deep Learning workloads that often involve Complex media data (images, video, audio, text documents and more).

Below we discuss some other Dataframe libraries and compare them to Daft.
