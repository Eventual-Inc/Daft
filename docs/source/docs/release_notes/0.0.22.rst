Daft 0.0.22 Release Notes
=========================

The Daft 0.0.22 release adds much more testing and bug fixes. The highlights are:

* Dynamic Runner speedups - our dynamic runners now outperform the existing runners and will be the default in the next release.
* Property-based tests with Hypothesis for ``.sort``
* Refactors to enable integration of Rust Series/vPartition/Expressions
