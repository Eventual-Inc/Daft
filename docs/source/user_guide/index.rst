Welcome to **Daft**!

Daft is a Python dataframe library that enables Pythonic data processing at large scale.

* **Fast** - Daft kernels are written and accelerated using Rust on Apache Arrow arrays.

* **Flexible** - you can work with any Python object in a Daft Dataframe.

* **Interactive** - Daft provides a first-class notebook experience.

* **Scalable** - Daft uses out-of-core algorithms to work with datasets that cannot fit in memory.

* **Distributed** - Daft scales to a cluster of machines using Ray to crunch terabytes of data.

* **Intelligent** - Daft performs query optimizations to speed up your work.

The core interface provided by Daft is the *DataFrame*, which is a table of data consisting of rows and columns. This user guide
aims to help Daft users master the usage of the Daft *DataFrame* for all your data processing needs!
