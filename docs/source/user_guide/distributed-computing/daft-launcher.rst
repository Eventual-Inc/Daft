Daft Launcher
=====================

Getting started with running daft at a distributed scale can be tough.
Therefore, we've created a simple, open-source launcher to help you get started.

The tool, `daft-launcher <https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/daft-launcher>`_, is open-source and available to be run today!
To install it, you can run ``pip install daft-launcher`` (or using ``uv``, you can run ``uv pip install daft-launcher``).

To get started with it, please refer to our MDBook documentation, available `here <https://eventual-inc.github.io/daft-launcher/>`_.
