Daft 0.0.24 Release Notes
=========================

The Daft 0.0.24 release adds many bugfixes and moves Daft much closer towards full integration of its Rust code. The highlights are:

* Better integrations with Ray Datasets, adding a ``DataFrame.from_ray_dataset`` constructor and leveraging its ArrowTensorExtension types when converting data.
* ``DataFrame.into_partitions`` API adds a much faster way of increasing/decreasing the number of partitions in a DataFrame without incurring a shuffle
