Daft 0.0.23 Release Notes
=========================

The Daft 0.0.23 release has some amazing highlights:

* Our Dynamic runners are now the default runners thanks to @xcharleslin
* Our first PR from @Asrst - added DataFrame.count_rows to get the length of a DataFrame!


New Features
------------

DataFrame.count_rows()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds an API to count the number of rows on a DataFrame, and a ``len`` method. Thanks to @Asrst for the PR!

See: `#553 <https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/pull/553>`_

Dynamic Runners as default runners
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our Dynamic Ray and Py runners are now the default runners, giving us much faster execution times!

See: `#564 <https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/pull/564>`_
