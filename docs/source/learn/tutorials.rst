Generating images from text with Mini DALL-E
--------------------------------------------

In this series of tutorials, we will be exploring using Daft to build a model that can generate images from text using the Mini DALL-E model. We will explore how to scale this up with GPUs and Ray, and eventually deploy our model as a HTTP service that can serve incoming requests.

1. `Running on GPUs <https://colab.research.google.com/github/Eventual-Inc/Daft/blob/main/tutorials/text_to_image/text_to_image_generation.ipynb>`_
2. Scaling up in the cloud with Ray **[Coming Soon]**
3. Building a HTTP service **[Coming Soon]**

Data-Centric Machine Learning with KITTI
----------------------------------------

Machine Learning models are only as good as the data that they are trained on, but building a workflow to continually improve your training datasets can often be very challenging. In this tutorial series, we show how Daft can be leveraged to easily process, query and leverage your data with the end goal of improving model performance on the autonomous driving dataset, KITTI.

1. Interacting with external services to build a data annotation pipeline **[Coming Soon]**
2. Data preparation for ML model training **[Coming Soon]**
