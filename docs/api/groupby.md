# GroupBy

When performing aggregations such as sum, mean and count, Daft enables you to group data by certain keys and aggregate within those keys.

Calling [`df.groupby()`][daft.DataFrame.groupby] returns a `GroupedDataFrame` object which is a view of the original DataFrame but with additional context on which keys to group on. You can then call various aggregation methods to run the aggregation within each group, returning a new DataFrame.

Learn more about [Aggregations and Grouping](../core_concepts.md#aggregations-and-grouping) in Daft User Guide.
