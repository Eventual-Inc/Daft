# Sessions

Sessions enable you to attach objects such as catalogs, providers, models, functions, and tables which are reference-able in DataFrame operations. The session also enables creating temporary objects which are accessible through both the Python and SQL APIs. Sessions hold configuration state such as current_catalog and current_namespace which are used in name resolution and can simplify your workflows. Learn more about [Sessions](../sessions.md) in the Daft User Guide.
